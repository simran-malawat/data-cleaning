Conclusions
As per the dataset, we can see that more than half of the top 10 channels are by individuals not comapanies. Individuals are giving tough competition to organisations. Males and Companies have equal number of channels in the top and double that of female.
Although Females are getting less views for their videos, they are getting the most likes for the videos they post compared to Males and Companies by a huge margin.
We observe that most of the channels belong to music industry. It seems music channels get the highest number of views of all categories.
Videos of short duration between 2 to 10 minutes are getting most likes on average followed by SuperLong videos of more than a hour long.
The videos of 1440p quality are getting more views on average followed by 720p quality.
Contrary to my expectation of average video views increasing every year, it fell down from last 5 years. Videos uploaded in 2017,2015,2014,2013 got more views on average compared to all years.
Videos uploaded in months of January and November got the highest views on average.
Videos uploaded on Fridays are getting the most views on average and those uploaded on Wednesday are getting the least.
